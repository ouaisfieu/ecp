🧵 THREAD: Belgium has been paying 273 organizations to criticize capitalism since 2003.

€50M+/year. 2,300 employees. Public money.

This is not a conspiracy theory. This is the "Éducation Permanente" system.

Let me explain 👇
```

**Tweet 2/6:**
```
In 2003, Belgium passed a decree creating a legal framework to fund organizations whose mission is to:

• Develop critical analysis of society
• Enable collective action for social change
• Train citizens in political participation

Yes, really. It's in the law.
```

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
Today, 273 organizations are funded under this system:

• Anti-globalization groups (ATTAC)
• Feminist organizations (Vie Féminine, Soralia)
• Worker education centers
• Cultural action groups (PAC)
• Environmental activists

All paid by the state to critique it.
```

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
The budget?

• €50M+/year in direct subsidies
• 73,395€ average per org
• 2,300+ full-time employees
• 4 "axes": citizen participation, training, research, awareness

This is infrastructure, not charity.
```

**Tweet 5/6:**
```
On January 22, 2026, three of these orgs (Amazone, Soralia, PAC) are hosting an event about women and the far-right.

We're organizing an international "raid" to learn how they built this model.

Why does this matter?

Because every country has activists struggling for funding.

Belgium built a SYSTEM. A legal framework. A replicable model.

If they can do it, why can't we?

The wildest thing about Belgium's Éducation Permanente system:

It's not hidden. It's not controversial there. It's just... normal.

273 orgs get paid to criticize the system. With the system's money.

Why don't we have this everywhere?

### Tweet J-3 (19 janvier)

I keep thinking about this:

Belgium created a LAW that forces the state to fund its own critics.

273 organizations. 50 million euros. Every year. Since 2003.

In 3 days, we're going to learn how they did it.
