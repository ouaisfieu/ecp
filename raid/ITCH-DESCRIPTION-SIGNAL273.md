## 🔐 What is SIGNAL_273?

**SIGNAL_273** is **not** a regular game.
It's an **investigation**, a **puzzle**, almost a **political awakening** 🧠🔓.

Its purpose is simple but disturbing:
👉 **decode a real system** hidden in plain sight
👉 **outside mainstream media**, **outside algorithms**, **outside noise**

Everything lives inside **a single HTML file**.

- No installation
- No account  
- No server
- Works **offline** — the truth doesn't need wifi

## 🧩 What will you discover?

The Belgian government pays **273 organizations** to criticize:
- capitalism
- patriarchy  
- state policies
- corporate power

**€50M+/year. 2,300 employees. Public money.**

This is not fiction. This is the **Decree of July 17, 2003**.
