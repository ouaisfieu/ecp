## POST 1 — r/belgium ou r/europe (Jour 2)

**Title:**
```
TIL Belgium pays 273 organizations €50M+/year to criticize capitalism, patriarchy, and the state — with public money
```

**Body:**
```
I stumbled upon this and I'm genuinely confused about how I feel.

Since 2003, the Belgian government (Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles) has funded 273 organizations under something called "Éducation Permanente" (Permanent Education). Their legal mission is to develop "critical analysis of society" and "collective action for social change."

These aren't small orgs. We're talking:
- €50M+ annual budget
- 2,300+ employees
- Organizations like ATTAC (anti-globalization), Vie Féminine (feminist), PAC (Présence et Action Culturelles)

The craziest part? It's been running for 20+ years and most Belgians I've talked to have never heard of it.

On January 22, 2026, some of these orgs are hosting an event and there's an "international raid" being organized to learn how they built this: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/janvier/22/

Has anyone here worked with these organizations? What's your take on this system?

[NEW ARG] SIGNAL_273 — Found this weird game about Belgium, turns out it's all real?
```

**Body:**
```
Just played this browser game called SIGNAL_273: https://ouaisfieu.itch.io/signal273

Started as a puzzle game about "decoding a signal" from Brussels. Hacker aesthetic, countdown timer, the works.

But here's the thing — as you solve the puzzles, you realize everything in the game is REAL.

273 organizations. €50M in public funding. A system that's been running since 2003.

And there's a countdown to January 22... which is apparently a real event happening in Brussels.

Anyone else looked into this? The rabbit hole goes deep.

## POST 3 — r/europe ou r/worldnews (Jour 8)

**Title:**
```
How Belgium built a €50M/year system to fund anti-capitalist organizations — and why it matters for the rest of us
```

**Body:**
```
I've been researching something called "Éducation Permanente" in Belgium and I think more people should know about this.

**The basics:**
- Since 2003, Belgium (specifically Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles) has funded 273 organizations
- Total budget: €50M+/year
- Their legal mission: "develop critical analysis of society" and "collective action for social change"

**Who gets funded:**
- ATTAC (anti-globalization)
- Feminist organizations
- Worker education centers
- Environmental groups
- Cultural action collectives

**Why it matters:**
This isn't charity or grants. It's a LEGAL FRAMEWORK. Permanent, structural funding for civil society to critique power.

On January 22, 2026, there's an "international raid" to learn how they built this model:
https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/janvier/22/

What do you think? Should other countries replicate this?

## POST 4 — r/france (Jour 2 alt)

**Title:**
```
La Belgique finance 273 associations pour critiquer le capitalisme — 50M€/an d'argent public
```

**Body:**
```
Je viens de tomber sur un truc fascinant.

Depuis 2003, la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles finance 273 organisations via le décret "Éducation Permanente". Leur mission légale : "développer l'analyse critique de la société" et "l'action collective pour le changement social".

On parle de :
- 50M€+/an de budget
- 2 300 salariés
- ATTAC, Vie Féminine, PAC, etc.

Le plus fou ? Ça existe depuis 20+ ans et la plupart des gens n'en ont jamais entendu parler.

Le 22 janvier 2026, un "raid international" est organisé pour comprendre comment ils ont construit ce modèle : https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/janvier/22/

Vous connaissiez ce système ? Ça vous inspire quoi ?

## POST 5 — r/latestagecapitalism ou r/socialism (Jour 10 alt)

**Title:**
```
Belgium has been paying people to criticize capitalism since 2003. €50M/year. 273 organizations. Here's how.
```

**Body:**
```
This isn't a meme. This is real.

Belgium (Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles) created a legal framework in 2003 called "Éducation Permanente" that funds organizations whose mission is to:

1. Develop critical analysis of society
2. Train citizens in political participation
3. Enable collective action for social change

**The numbers:**
- 273 funded organizations
- €50M+/year in public subsidies
- 2,300+ employees
- Anti-globalization groups, feminist orgs, worker centers, environmental activists

**The point:**
This isn't charity. It's INFRASTRUCTURE. Permanent, structural funding for civil society to organize against capital.

On January 22, 2026, there's an international "raid" on a Belgian event to learn how they built this and document it for replication: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/janvier/22/

If Belgium can do it, why can't we push for this everywhere?
