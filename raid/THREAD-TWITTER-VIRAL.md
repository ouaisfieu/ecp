🚨 THREAD: Belgium has a STATE SECRET that every activist needs to know.

The government PAYS 273 organizations to criticize capitalism, patriarchy, and state policies.

€50M+/year. 2,300 employees. Public money.

This is not a joke. This is the law. 🧵

## TWEET 2/15

In 2003, the Wallonia-Brussels Federation passed the "Permanent Education" decree.

Its stated goal: "develop active citizenship by enabling individuals to ANALYZE SOCIETY, understand its mechanisms, and ACT COLLECTIVELY for social change."

Yes, really.

## TWEET 3/15

The funded organizations include:

• ATTAC chapters (anti-globalization)
• Feminist collectives
• Anti-poverty groups
• Environmental activists
• Union education wings
• Anti-racist organizations

All receiving public salaries.

## TWEET 4/15

How much money are we talking about?

• €73,395/year per full-time employee
• 273 recognized organizations
• 2,300+ workers in the sector
• €50M+ annual budget

These aren't volunteers. These are CIVIL SERVANTS of critique.

## TWEET 5/15

The 4 "axes" of Permanent Education:

1️⃣ Citizen participation & political education
2️⃣ Training activists & organizers
3️⃣ Producing critical analyses & tools
4️⃣ Public awareness campaigns

Organizations can specialize in 1-4 of these.

## TWEET 6/15

Some examples of what they do with public money:

• Run anti-capitalist reading circles
• Train union delegates
• Publish feminist magazines
• Organize climate protests
• Fight housing speculation
• Support undocumented migrants

Legally. Funded.

"But surely they can't criticize the government that funds them?"

LOL.

The decree EXPLICITLY protects their independence. Organizations regularly publish reports attacking government policies.

It's literally their job.

---

## TWEET 8/15

Why doesn't anyone know about this?

1. It's in French (Francophone Belgium only)
2. The government doesn't advertise it internationally
3. Belgian activists take it for granted
4. No one thought to export the model

Until now.

## TWEET 9/15

On January 22nd, three of these organizations are hosting an event in Brussels:

• Amazone (gender equality center)
• Soralia (200+ feminist local groups)
• PAC (largest EP movement)

Topic: Women and the far-right.

## TWEET 10/15

We're organizing an INTERNATIONAL RAID on this event.

Not to disrupt it — to AMPLIFY it.

We want to flood it with international observers who will discover this model and ask: "How do we replicate this at home?"

---

## TWEET 12/15

The organizations hosting the event don't know about this raid.

We're surprising them with international attention.

Imagine being a Belgian feminist activist and suddenly getting messages from activists in Brazil, Kurdistan, and California asking "HOW DID YOU BUILD THIS?"

## TWEET 13/15

Everything is documented and open-source:

📋 List of 273 organizations (CSV)
⚖️ Legal framework explained
📖 "Arpentage" method guide
💡 The full funding model

Take it. Adapt it. Push your government to do the same.

---

## TWEET 14/15

The hashtag: #BelgiumPaysCritics

Use it. Spread it. Make noise.

Every activist in the world deserves to know that another model is possible.

That governments CAN fund their own critics.

That Belgium did it 20 years ago.
