**Title:** 
TIL Belgium pays 273 organizations to criticize capitalism — €50M+/year in public funding, 2,300 employees

**Body:**

The Wallonia-Brussels Federation (French-speaking Belgium) has had a law since 2003 called "Permanent Education" that funds organizations whose stated mission is to:

> "develop active citizenship by enabling individuals to analyze society, understand its mechanisms, and act collectively for social change"

This includes:
- ATTAC chapters (anti-globalization)
- Feminist collectives  
- Anti-poverty organizations
- Environmental groups
- Union education wings

**The numbers:**
- 273 recognized organizations
- €73,395/year per full-time employee (public money)
- 2,300+ workers in the sector
- €50M+ annual budget

These organizations regularly publish reports criticizing government policies, corporate power, and capitalist structures. The decree explicitly protects their editorial independence.

On January 22nd, some activists are organizing an "international raid" on a Belgian event to learn how they built this ecosystem and document it for replication elsewhere.

Has anyone heard of similar models in other countries? Why isn't this more widely known?

**Title:**
Belgium has state-funded organizations whose job is to criticize capitalism and train activists — Here's how they did it

**Body:**

I just discovered something wild about Belgium.

Since 2003, the Wallonia-Brussels Federation has a "Permanent Education" decree that provides public funding to organizations working on:

1. **Citizen participation** — helping people analyze society and act collectively
2. **Training activists** — education for union delegates, organizers, community leaders
3. **Critical analysis** — producing research and tools that question power structures
4. **Public awareness** — campaigns on social issues

The kicker? These organizations are EXPECTED to be critical of the system. The law explicitly protects their independence.

**Some examples of funded orgs:**
- ATTAC Belgium (anti-globalization)
- CEPAG (socialist union education wing)
- Feminist movements like Soralia
- Anti-racist collectives
- Environmental justice groups

**Budget:** €50M+/year for 273 organizations employing 2,300 people.

An "international raid" is being organized on January 22nd to connect with Belgian activists and learn how this model was built: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/raid/

What do you think — is this model replicable? What would it take to push for something similar elsewhere?

**Title:**
Belgium funds 273 anti-capitalist education orgs with public money — International raid to learn the model Jan 22

**Body:**

This might sound like a contradiction but hear me out.

Belgium (specifically the French-speaking region) has had a "Permanent Education" law since 2003 that gives public funding to organizations whose mission is to develop critical thinking about society.

In practice, this means:
- ATTAC chapters get government salaries
- Feminist collectives receive €73k/year per employee
- Anti-poverty groups are publicly funded
- Environmental activists have stable incomes

The total: 273 organizations, 2,300 workers, €50M+/year in public funding.

**The interesting part:** these organizations openly criticize the state, capitalism, and power structures. The law explicitly protects their editorial independence.

Is this co-optation? Maybe. But it's also 2,300 people being paid to do radical education full-time instead of having to work shit jobs on the side.

On January 22nd, there's an "international raid" to join a Belgian event, ask them how they built this, and document it: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/raid/

Even if you're skeptical, isn't it worth studying how they did it?

**Title:**
TIL Belgium has 273 government-funded organizations whose job is to criticize society — including anti-capitalist and feminist groups

**Body:**

The Wallonia-Brussels Federation (French-speaking Belgium) has a unique system called "Permanent Education" (Éducation Permanente).

Since 2003, the government funds 273 organizations employing 2,300 people whose mission is to:
- Help citizens analyze how society works
- Train community organizers and activists  
- Produce critical analysis of policies
- Run public awareness campaigns

The funded organizations include ATTAC (anti-globalization), feminist collectives, environmental groups, anti-poverty organizations, and union education wings.

**Budget:** approximately €50M/year, with each full-time position funded at €73,395/year.

The law explicitly protects their editorial independence, meaning they can (and do) criticize government policies.

I found this out because there's apparently an "international raid" being organized on January 22nd to bring attention to this model: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/raid/

Any Belgians here who can confirm this is real? Why isn't this model more widely known or replicated?

**Title:**
International activists are organizing a "raid" on Belgian EP organizations to learn how we built the Permanent Education system

**Body:**

Apparently people outside Belgium are discovering our "Éducation Permanente" system and losing their minds.

For those who don't know: since 2003, the FWB funds ~273 organizations (2,300 jobs) whose mission is basically to help citizens think critically about society. This includes ATTAC, feminist groups, union education wings, etc.

For us it's normal. For activists in other countries, it's apparently science fiction.

Now some international folks are organizing a "raid" on the Les Vigilantes event on January 22nd (Amazone/Soralia/PAC) to bring attention to this model: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/raid/

The organizations hosting the event don't know about this — it's meant to be a surprise.

Thoughts? Is our EP system really that unique? Anyone working in the sector who can share their perspective?

## r/Feminism (300k membres)

**Title:**
Belgium publicly funds feminist organizations to criticize patriarchy — 200+ local groups, government salaries, editorial independence

**Body:**

I just learned something incredible about Belgium's approach to feminist organizing.

The Wallonia-Brussels Federation has a "Permanent Education" system that provides public funding to organizations working on social critique and citizen education.

This includes major feminist organizations like:
- **Soralia** (200+ local feminist groups, linked to Solidaris mutual)
- **Vie Féminine** (Christian workers' feminist movement)
- **Amazone** (national gender equality resource center)

These organizations receive government funding (€73k/year per full-time employee) but maintain full editorial independence. They openly criticize government policies, patriarchal structures, and social inequalities.

On January 22nd, Amazone + Soralia + PAC are hosting a collective reading event about the book "Les Vigilantes" (women and the far-right).

An "international raid" is being organized to bring attention to this model: https://ouaisfieu.github.io/ecp/raid/

Has anyone heard of similar government-funded feminist education systems elsewhere?
